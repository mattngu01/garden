Musashi Miyamoto goes on to learn more about his opponent to get rid of his fear. Should do the same with my own. 

- Am afraid of being deemed "not good enough" for at volleyball [[Chicago Stories#^c7973a]].
	- why is this the case? -> brings up memories of club tryouts & high school.
		- why should I be scared of not being good enough? -> unsure.
		- conflict of personal opinion & everything I've experienced up to here, and what an external source is saying about me
	- just play and have my own fun. "Preoccupied with a single life, you won't see the tree. Preoccupied with a single tree, you'll miss the whole forest".
		- I'm preoccupied with my struggle of conflicting views of myself. This manifests itself as fear and I won't be able to play well.
	- being deemed not good enough is not an invalidation of the effort I've put in nor my identity. It does not change the fact that I've played vball for over 10 years now, and I still enjoy it.
