some things I want to address in therapy
1. dealing with suicidal thoughts & anxiety when under pressure / stress

1st mtg with depth counseling
- they do a more holistic, deeper counseling that addresses root problems instead of some therapy places that just  give you techniques to deal with stuff

next mtg
- didn't feel too good this last monday
- feeling discouraged about not getting any results from job search?
- try to reframe it in my mind as "i don't want to be in this position" vs. "i want to unalive myself"
- for next time, i want a therapist that is more friendly and talk about themselves and share their life
	- psychoanalytic / psychodynamic 
	- "blank slate" / classicalist -> I don't want that
	- I like having the back and forth dialogue
- Acupuncture -> Source Healing

## Therapy 2023.07.19
- last weekend having trouble relaxing
- today feeling really irritable, out of it, etc

## What we discussed / takeway
- don't be so hard on yourself, just because you did something and it didn't turn out right doesn't necessarily mean that it was your fault
	- didn't discuss but to bring up next time: that's how it was when I was growing up, it was instilled in me that if I didn't get the result or that things didn't work out, then there was always something you could've done better or that there was something that you didn't do that caused it to happen
	- remember me forgetting my book at school and crying and her just saying “well that’s just your fault, nothing you can do about it”


- 07.30 Sunday - went out to play volleyball with friends, couldn’t really enjoy myself because i felt like i should’ve been using my time better to apply to jobs or leetcode
	- got in a similar thought pattern of wanting to kill myself, or just being harsh on myself 
	- “what are you doing? should be doing X instead, wasting your time” 
	- i don’t know what to do to stop this kind of thinking 
	- tried thinking about what i’m grateful for and logically i’m not in a bad position but it still feels bad 
- 08.16.2023 Wednesday - talked about traumatic shameful experiences
	- to bring up next time: going to new Viet school and being treated like an idiot & a child
- 08.23.2023 - more traumautic shameful experiences
	- talked about when I yelled at my mom about stopping competitive swimming, going to the new vietnamese school
	- to talk about next time: did i have any positive teachers, role models, etc
		- also to mention I think around that time was when I started feeling depressed and suicidal, i feeling a lot around that time of "i want to run away"
		- memory of my brother talking me down from walking away when i was really young and my mom was upset at me
			- maybe bc of when my mom had that time of throwing the laundry down from the second floor? 
		- another memory of me taking a walk when studying vietnamese and my family thought I ran away
		- sad because of volleyball; being upset and feeling displaced
- I told my mom about moving back, she told me that she just wanted me to be happy. She took it well, she wanted me to think through about it

## 2023.09.13
- things to talk about
	- feeling stressed about moving
		- my uncle moving so fast about finding a new tenant, I haven't told him yet about thinking of staying 
	- unsure on what to do
	- my mom saying that I shouldn't quit my job xd

## 2023.10.18
- TRY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT MAKES ME SAY NO WHEN I DON'T WANNA GO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE

- had a panic attack at night 11/12


## Thanksgiving Vacation
- not having a vacation and having to do chores
- i don’t want to be around family when im taking my vacation it stresses me out and irritates me
	- a true vacation for me is probably a quiet one
- my mom tried to talk to me again about moving back
	- don’t quit because it is hard to find a job
	- she doesn’t let me fail, that is the biggest issue
	- she keeps asking why when i already told her and she doesn’t take my reason as valid, i couldn’t stay silent bc she kept asking
- i want to kill myself
- for some of my dads relatives and they said the same thing, this is why i don’t like telling people what i’m doing
	- i think i just wish people accepted what i was doing  judgement?
	- killing myself seems like a more doable option
