veritasium - the 4 things it takes to be an expert

very similar to what makes a video game good? look into notes
pattern recognition (chunking)

1. valid environment
	- it has to be the same scenario, journalists cannot repeat political events (these events are usually infrequent and you can't really replicate these events)
	- stocks are a low validity environment, the results don't reflect the quality of the decisionmaking
	- 10k hours?
2. timely feedback
3. repeated experiences
4. practicing deliberately - attempting things you can't do yet, not just staying in your comfort zone
