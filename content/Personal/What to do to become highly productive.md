>I know this is going to sound heretical, but you need to wean yourself off the coffee. Caffeine provides a false sense of stimulation that results in a crash and low-energy/poor concentration later in the day.

> Wake up 45 minutes early, drink 500ml water, do some basic yoga (Sun salutation, even, just to move), five minutes of mindfulness meditation, a light breakfast, 
> and a cold shower, then review yesterday's study material for 15 minutes before you go.
> 
> After work, walk, run, lift, or otherwise move your body, giving yourself a full hour between work and studying.
> 
> When it's time to study, remove all distractions. Turn off your phone and put it in another room. Every excuse you have for having your phone nearby? Find another way so you don't look at your phone while studying.
> 
> While studying, think about your material as though you need to teach it (because you will - to yourself). What are the key points? What's the major thread, narrative, purpose, objective, whatever? What are the parts that contribute to that whole? How do they all fit together? Are there mnemonics or acronyms to help you remember things? Write these down! Research shows that [writing things down helps memory](http://www.medicaldaily.com/why-using-pen-and-paper-not-laptops-boosts-memory-writing-notes-helps-recall-concepts-ability-268770), specifically because it forces you to summarize and synthesize. Your notes from each night will be your review for the next morning.
> 
> After 45 minutes of studying, take a ten minute break. Go for a quick walk, go to the bathroom (without your phone), get a healthy snack, stretch a little. Most importantly, _**no entertainment**_! Distractions will mess with your memory. You need to give your brain time to process the things you just learned, so take a low-mental-impact break.
> 
> When you return to your studying, go over the mistrial you just learned. Can you clearly articulate it without reading your notes? What questions are you stuck on? Which parts don't make sense? Write down your questions, and seek out the answers.
> 
> Feeling like it's hard, or you're lodging the resolve to continue? Who are you doing this for? Who's paying you to stay invested? That's right - future you. This time investment will pay off a hundred-fold in more satisfying (and hopefully better-paying) work one day. This two hour study session will push you towards a lifetime of better earning, to the tune of thousands of extra dollars. So think of future you cheering you on, thinking you for seeing the big picture, and reminding you that you ARE getting paid for this work, just not right now.
> 
> Finally, when you're getting tired, it's time to stop. Drink a litre of water and get a good night's sleep. Laying in bed is not the time to review your learning or worry about anything at all. Meditate a few minute, keep screens out of the bedroom (and off for the half hour before bed), and remember that you're building something amazing ghost is totally worth making new, healthier habits.
