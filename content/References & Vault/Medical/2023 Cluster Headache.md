## Medicine
- emgality worked in lowering severity and frequency
- tried dexamethasone 4mg
	- super bad hiccups, but did not really affect much
	- took at beginning of recent cycle in last november…?
- try magnesium glycinate, not as upsetting to the stomach (should be taking 800mg)
- try medro dosepak along with emgality at start of cycle
