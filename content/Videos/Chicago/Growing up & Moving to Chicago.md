**Potential title idea:** 2022 & moving

- start off with clip of alex trolling in volleyball?
- a lot has happened this year -> say everything really fast
	- 2021.12.30 - job offer from IMC 
		- rejected other offers bc i was lazy
	- released a valorant video 
	- ate a lot of food
	- lots of volleyball
	- sold all my stuff
	- went to las vegas
	- sequoia
	- seattle
	- graduated
	- started a new job
	- "now here i am to chicago" -> last picture of it snowing outside
- video games and its relevance in my life is changing
	- games themselves aren't particularly fun
		- is it the quality of the games? has the novelty worn off? am I just growing up?
	- more about the social aspect than the games
	- gone are the days of playing minecraft and league all day
		- spending more and more time alone in the minecraft server
- being in a different timezone with friends
	- hard to play games
	- obviously can't hang out, have to meet other people
		- how hard can it be to find someone you actually vibe with?
- i'm scared of change
- there's something sad about your entire life changing and potentially going downhill from there
- there's no resolution of this, just the passing of time
- there's a lot of waking up and asking myself "what am i doing with my life"
	- and the answer is gonna be "i don't know"
	- potential alternative: "but life moves on"
- but there's good to moving & being in chicago
	- living with roselle is fun
	- having friends visit
	- recording things a lot more
	- 
- old me would've asked who i am now "who are you" - "wait a minute, who are you"
- i remember hearing somewhere that life is about "enjoying the passing of time", and this past year was great. Thanks 2022
