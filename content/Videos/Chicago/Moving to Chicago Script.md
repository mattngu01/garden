Thanks Alex. Goddamn right I am.

Chapter 1 - 2022

A lot happened this year. In December 30th 2021 I received a job offer and nearly a week later I accepted it. And then I released a valorant video, ate a lot of food, played lots of volleyball, graduated, went to las vegas, went to sequoia, went to seattle, said goodbye to everyone, moved to Chicago, started my new job and here we are.

CHAPTER 2 - Change

You know, I never really intended to move here. I originally planned to get a job in California, and then move out and well, that'd be it and my life would be complete.

Well, if it isn't the consequences of my actions. I got kinda scared I wouldn't get a job and then I'd be a bum at home, and I'd probably go insane and turn into the Joker [mention reference here about someone going crazy, idk who].

It's kinda rough out here. Being in a different timezone with friends, it's hard to play games at the same time with them and not to mention, oh, the 2,000 miles between us ya know it only takes 29 hours to get there. Not to mention, why is it so hard to find someone you actually vibe with?

Even then, the one thing we have that we can to do together, I'm not even sure if I enjoy it as much. Video games are... aren't the same. Is it because they're worse? Has the novelty worn off? Am I... just changing and growing into a different person? Or are the people around me doing the same? Imagine changing.

I think it's really moreso the social aspect. Just 5 people, spending time together. 

But gone are the days of playing minecraft and league all day. Me and my friends started up a minecraft server recently to live the good old days like we do every year, but lately I've been spending a higher proportion of it playing alone than with other people.

I'm scared of change. There's something scary about making a decision and it all going downhill from there and you can look back and pinpoint that decision and say, "Yeah. I really regret making that decision. I hope I never have to live through that again".

Essentially, I spent the last [X] amount of minutes saying, "Yeah. I regret making that decision."

And when I wake up for work in the morning, look outside the window and ask myself, "What am I doing with my life?".

As of right now, the answer's gonna be, "I don't know." There's no resolution I have to show off in this video - there's no grandiose eureka, no aha moment realizing the secret to happiness.

But life moves on. 

There's some good to moving & being here. Being with Roselle is fun. She helps me stay sane here. I don't think I could do it without her.

Being far away from friends makes it even better when we actually see each other - we know now that maybe we won't be able to see each other like this forever.

I like to think that in the future, this just becomes something that I can casually say, "Yeah, it sucked" and move on to talk about something else, because there'd be better and greater things to talk about and do.

Because of everything that happened this year, the old me 5 years ago would've asked the current me "Who are you? It looks like you've made it"

I remember hearing somewhere that life is about "enjoying the passing of time", and this past year was definitely something. Thanks, 2022.
