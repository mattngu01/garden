 Derezz the master control program

 MCP turned out to be evil and had become intent on world domination.
 This commit throws Tron's disc into MCP (causing its deresolution)
 and turns it back into a chess game.
```

2. limit subject line to 50 characters
   - having a hard time summarizing? might be committing too many changes at once
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
   - ex: refactor system for readability, update getting started docs
   - NOT "fixed bug with Y"
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs _how_
	- the how will be explained by the code & comments

   Simplify serialize.h's exception handling

   Remove the 'state' and 'exceptmask' from serialize.h's stream
   implementations, as well as related methods.

   As exceptmask always included 'failbit', and setstate was always
   called with bits = failbit, all it did was immediately raise an
   exception. Get rid of those variables, and replace the setstate
   with direct exception throwing (which also removes some dead
   code).

   As a result, good() is never reached after a failure (there are
   only 2 calls, one of which is in tests), and can just be replaced
   by !eof().

   fail(), clear(n) and exceptions() are just never called. Delete
   them.
