questions i was asked:
- how would i prevent developers from pushing bad code directly to production? (both preventing bad code & actually prevent devs from pushing to prod environment)
- describe the largest CI/CD pipeline that you've worked on
- what are some essential things that an SRE should know when debugging a linux box
- A dev is saying that an application is "acting weirdly". What would you do to figure out what was wrong?
	- if it was an http rest api, then what would you look at?
- Say there's a bug in a library that 200 services use. How would you get this fix out?
- Describe a common template for setting up a build pipeline. What would this contain or what characteristics would it have?
- describe difference between regression & integration testing

## Reflection
- a lot of these questions was mostly just technical knowledge. I think that I definitely could've passed this, but I was caught super off-guard by the questions
	- I kept skipping over the obvious. For "debugging a linux box" I skimmed over `grep`, `vim`, `du`, `iotop`, `traceroute` all those `tops`, and ended up yapping about `atop` and `dmesg`...
	- Be more specific in my clarifying questions: for "debugging a linux box" I didn't clarify: tools? general strategy? technologies?
- asking clarifying questions: good! 
- I had prepped for "story" / past experience type questions, but not for hypotheticals
- I definitely goofed on asking questions about the company: decided to go on the spot and ask "what if I decide to go against company values?". Definitely a red flag in their eyes
- I was running out of time, but the interviewer was interested in FPGA's and had a sega atari cabinet in the background. Why didn't I ask about those? Make me seem like a personable person....
- Be patient and listen to the interview, do NOT talk over them (i did it once in the interview)


## Action Items
- [ ] study up on SRE-specific knowledge questions (see [[2023-09-22 Interview Links to go over]])
- [ ] study up on backend knowledge questions (see [[2023-09-22 Interview Links to go over]]
- [ ]
