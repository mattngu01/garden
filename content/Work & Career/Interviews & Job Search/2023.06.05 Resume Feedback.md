- it seems to be that a lot of people see my "one year" as an SWE at UC Innovation as an actual one year - is this good or bad? seems like expectations are higher for me

For company A. I like what you did with bullet number 2 because it explains WHAT your did to ensure the system kept operating. For bullet one you could expand on Load blanacing solutions (How you did it if it was manauly or a tool).

Same with bullet 3. I want to know what you did to keep its uptime.

Bullet 4 talk more about what oyu did with the pipelines to enable build count.

Bullet 5 how,what did you do to ensure the system is up.


As for you job search, make sure you are talking to company recruiter and not just sending applications. Remember its a sales game. Top of the funnel is number of recruiters (people) you've talked to, and the end is number of offers extended.
