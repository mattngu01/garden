- "the cheese touch" -> there are a lot of services / codebases that are not owned by any team & aren't maintained. Typically when an urgent issue comes up regarding these, then the last person who touched it will get pinged / asked for more context & info and are assumed they are the owner
	- people will avoid touching these unmaintained services and codebases in fear of being pigeon-holed into being the point of contact for these. THE CHEESE TOUCH IS REAL
		- this is especially important for career and technical growth, as you will actively avoid solving particular issues because you'll get pigeon-holed
	- in combination w/ the lack of tracking of what people are working on (at least in the Central Services team), then you can work on pretty much whatever you want then
- lack of transparency for promotions & long term growth
	- flat structure at imc, no levels of engineers
	- salary pay isn't very transparent
	- "engineer II or staff engineer can do this" -> no example of that here. You just do work, and it's like "well good job, keep doing it!"
- flat structure at imc, part two: managers seem to have both IC & managing roles, but can't seem to do either well
	- ex: skip hops into issues sometimes seemingly from my pov without much context, says something that is out of base (imo)
		- gave feedback before that I don't see a lot of written communication externally with our team on what we are doing, or in general I don't see much communication with other people
		- ex: skip hops in, says we shouldn't have anonymous users deleting artifacts from our storages. I ask, "what is the recommended way to go about this?" No answer, despite briefly in a meeting before showing what the desired state of our artifact storages are. Where is the guidelines I should be following for, when what I'm doing currently is not ok?
- leadership issues & micromanagement
	- a lot of times my skip will be _very_ engrossed in certain tasks, but for problems that need leadership intervention, they are absent . It seems to me that they are focusing on the wrong thing. (pretty much an extension of the one before)
	- ex: alert comes up -> coworker says "hey that's me testing something" -> skip: "there was a failure from this alert". This happens in IM where this can all be seen from one screen.
