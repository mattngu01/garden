- with a brute force algo that calculates a problem, you can use memoization to optimize the earlier subsets of problems
	- the problem must be able to be split into smaller sub problems that make up the answer, and is deterministic
- dynamic programming can be applied to two sets of problems:
	- finding an optimal solution
	- counting total number of possible solutions
