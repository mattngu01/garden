## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        first, second = 0, len(height)-1
        max_area = 0
        
        while first < second:
            current_area = min(height[first], height[second]) * (second - first)
            
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area)
            
            if height[first] < height[second]:
                first += 1
            else: 
                second -= 1
        
        return max_area

**Peeked at solution?:** Yes, pretty much had to look twice at it to get it (i did think of a similar solution liek before, but was stuck on the criteria for moving the two pointers in)

## submitted solution, explained
- two pointer starting at both ends
- code should be pretty explanatory
- why is it the case that the criteria for moving in is the higher of the two? not really sure
	- idk if this is something you just have to know, but it seems to make sense however I can't actually explain why 

## proof / solution taken from online
1.  The widest container (using first and last line) is a good candidate, because of its width. Its water level is the height of the smaller one of first and last line.
2.  All other containers are less wide and thus would need a higher water level in order to hold more water.
3.  The smaller one of first and last line doesn't support a higher water level and can thus be safely removed from further consideration.
