## submitted solution
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

import random 

class Solution(object):

    def __init__(self, head):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        self.data = [head.val]
        self.head = head

        pointer = head.next

        while pointer != None:
            self.data.append(pointer.val)
            pointer = pointer.next
        
        
    def getRandom(self):
        """
        :rtype: int
        """

        return random.choice(self.data)
        


# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(head)
# param_1 = obj.getRandom()
```
**Runtime:**

**Peeked at solution?:** No

## Proper solution, explained
- supposed to use "reservoir sampling" -> tldr; as you're traversing through the list, pick a random probability between 0 & 1, then if it's one then that's the "random number". Otherwise, keep going
