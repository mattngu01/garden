```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if len(intervals) == 0:
            intervals.append(newInterval)
            return intervals 

        new_intervals = []
        index = 0
        while index < len(intervals) and intervals[index][1] < newInterval[0]:
            new_intervals.append(intervals[index])
            index += 1
        
        while index < len(intervals) and intervals[index][0] <= newInterval[1]:
            newInterval[0] = min(newInterval[0], intervals[index][0])
            newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], intervals[index][1])
            index += 1
        
        new_intervals.append(newInterval)
        
        while index < len(intervals):
            new_intervals.append(intervals[index])
            index += 1
    
        return new_intervals

        # add all intervals that are not an intersection, before
        # the "last" one here, update the second entry to be the max
        # in the middle, combine all intervals & get the min / max of the interval
        # at the end, add the rest if it's not overlapping
            
            


        # iterate through all intervals, discard all the intervals that are a subset of the newInterval
        # keep note of the approximate position the newInterval would be inserted in
        # modify the last number of the approx pos, modify the first number of the approx pos
        # what if the interval is not in any intervals? insert it at the pos then? what if it gets inserted before? what if it gets inserted last?

```

**Peeked at solution?:** Yes, I am dumb

## submitted solution, explained

"simple" iterating through all of the array.

1. Add all intervals before the newinterval, that are not an intersecting
2. Any intersecting intervals are merged into newInterval
	1. merge -> the max & minimum of the intervals are taken, tldr the union
3. add the newInterval
4. add the rest of the intervals that are greater than the newInterval, but don't intersect
