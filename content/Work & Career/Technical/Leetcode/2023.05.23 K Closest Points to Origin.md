## submitted solution, explained

The better solution than this is to use a priority queue (in Python it's a heapq).... I originally thought this but didn't think it would work. And the PriorityQueue class in Python turned out to be not what I was looking for.

TLDR; priority queue w/ distances as the thing to set priority by. This will ensure it keeps `k` amt of elements.
