## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = 0

        if len(s) <= 1:
            return len(s)
        
        size = 0
        longest_substring = set()
        while left < len(s) and right < len(s):
            
            if s[right] not in longest_substring:
                longest_substring.add(s[right])
                right += 1
            else:
                longest_substring = set()
                left += 1
                right = left
            
            size = max(size, len(longest_substring))
            
        return size

**Peeked at solution?:** No, but this definitely isn't the most optimal way to do it.

## submitted solution, explained

The optimal solution is essentially the same, but just one tweak.

You store the last seen index of a particular character in a hashmap. Once you hit a duplicate, store the new last seen to that one.
