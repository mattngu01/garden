## submitted solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        queue = []
        if root != None:
            queue.append((root, 0))
        visited = []

        while len(queue) > 0:
            current, depth = queue.pop(0)

            if depth < len(visited): #if "list" for to carry nodes in that depth exists
                visited[depth].append(current.val)
            else:
                visited.append([current.val])

            if current.left is not None:
                queue.append((current.left, depth+1))
            
            if current.right is not None:
                queue.append((current.right, depth+1))
        
        return visited
```

**Peeked at solution?:** I had to look up how to implement a breadth first search. I knew that BFS would result in this, but didn't remember how to implement it. I was thinking otherwise I do DFS and keep track of the height / depth, but tbh it feels very inefficient and not good.

## submitted solution, explained

Pretty much just BFS. Have a queue, and put the current node's children into the queue (FIFO). Done iteratively.
