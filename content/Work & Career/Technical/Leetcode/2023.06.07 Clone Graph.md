**Peeked at solution?:** no, but i did use the test cases a lot

## submitted solution, explained

this is not really good code at all, i just wanted to get through this problem today. I don't think it was particularly hard, but i struggled a bit for some reason

the "optimal" solution is honestly pretty much what i tried to do before i rewrote the whole solution - i feel dumb now looking at it lol

pretty much have a queue, and a hashmap of the clones

1. for each neighbor in the current node, if the neighor doesn't exist in hashmap create it & add to the queue
2. append the neighbor to the current_node_clone's list
