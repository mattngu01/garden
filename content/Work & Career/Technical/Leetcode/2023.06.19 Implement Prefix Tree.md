# Your Trie object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Trie()
# obj.insert(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
# param_3 = obj.startsWith(prefix)

**Peeked at solution?:** pretty much yes, had no idea what a trie was. Looked up a trie was on youtube

## submitted solution, explained

A trie is essentially a N-ary tree, which is optimized for string prefixes. This is really only used in situations where you have stuff like autocomplete, dealing with strings & constantly searching strings, where you would have too much replication holding each word. **A trie has very efficient prefix queries (how many words start with "app"?)**

Each node stores a map / array of other nodes, corresponding with a character (char -> Node). Each node can also specify if it is the end of a word. The other functions should be relatively intuitive to work out.
