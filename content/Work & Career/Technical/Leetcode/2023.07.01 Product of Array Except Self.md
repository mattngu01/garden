## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        right_product = [1 for x in nums]
        right_product[-1] = nums[-1]
        left_product = [1 for x in nums]
        left_product[0] = nums[0]

        for x in range(len(nums)-2, -1, -1):
            right_product[x] = right_product[x+1] * nums[x]

        for y in range(1, len(nums)):
            left_product[y] = left_product[y-1] * nums[y]

        for z in range(1, len(nums)-1):
            nums[z] = left_product[z-1] * right_product[z+1]
        
        nums[0] = right_product[1]
        nums[-1] = left_product[-2]

        return nums
```

**Peeked at solution?:** yes, for some reason I couldn't really solve this on my own lol

## submitted solution, explained

essentially the product of $x[i]$ is the product of everything left of $i$, and everything to the right of $i$, so that if 

```
y = prefix products of x
z = postfix / suffix products of x (essentially the opposite of Y, going the other way)

then x[i] = y[i-1] * z[i+1]

OR

x[i] = product of x[0] to x[i-1] * product of x[i+1] to x[end]
```
