## submitted solution
```python
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.min = []
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        if self._is_min(val):
            self.min.append(val)

        self.stack.append(val)

    def pop(self) -> None:
        if self.min[-1] == self.stack[-1]:
            self.min.pop()
        
        self.stack.pop()


    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1]
        

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.min[-1]
        
    def _is_min(self, val: int) -> bool:
        if len(self.min) == 0:
            return True
        return val <= self.min[-1]

```

**Peeked at solution?:** kind of, googled it real quick then saw the gist of the solution w/o actually looking at solution code

## submitted solution, explained

Pretty much just have two stacks, one to hold the minimum values and the other for the actual stack.

A good idea I saw in the solutions is to make it a linked list / stack of Nodes. Each node would keep track of the minimum of that stack so far.
