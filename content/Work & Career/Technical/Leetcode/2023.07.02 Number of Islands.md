**Peeked at solution?:** Nope, I'm actually really proud of this

## submitted solution, explained

I remember William Lin doing a video of this lol.

Essentially, we can count each "1" in as an island. By doing traversal on the connected islands and marking the rest of the island as "visited", we can skip the whole island because we already counted it. Then just iterate through all the tiles, skipping the "visited" tiles. This is essentially $O(m * n)$ .
