## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        traversal = self.inOrderTraversal(root)
        print(traversal)

        x = traversal[0]
        for z in range(1, len(traversal)):
            if traversal[z] <= x:
                return False
            
            x = traversal[z]

        return True
        

    def inOrderTraversal(self, root) -> []:
        traversal_order = []

        if root == None:
            return []
        
        if root.left:
            traversal_order += self.inOrderTraversal(root.left)
        
        traversal_order += [root.val]

        if root.right:
            traversal_order += self.inOrderTraversal(root.right)

        return traversal_order
```

**Peeked at solution?:** Yes, googled how to do in order traversal briefly then coded

## submitted solution, explained

Doing an in order traversal _should_ yield an array of numbers that are non-decreasing. Doing that, then verifying it is indeed non-decreasing will do the job.

In order traversal should be left, root, right. Find a way to do this, then pretty much the problem is done.
