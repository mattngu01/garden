**Peeked at solution?:** Yes, I pretty much gave up

## submitted solution, explained

The submitted solution is almost there. All that was needed to do left was to modify the algorithms to take in a list of rotten oranges to start with, instead of starting at only one rotten orange.

Pretty much for every rotten orange, get the available fresh oranges adjacent to them. For each wave of fresh oranges, increase the minute by 1 instead of doing it for every individual fresh orange. Use BFS to "queue" through all the fresh oranges.
