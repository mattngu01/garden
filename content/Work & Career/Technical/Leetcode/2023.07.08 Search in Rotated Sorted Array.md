**Peeked at solution?:** yes, i thought you could sort it first and then do it, but then i guess that's not really optimal. 

## submitted solution, explained

Optimal solution is mostly just a modified binary search.

```
Let's say `nums` looks like this: [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

Because it's not fully sorted, we can't do normal binary search. But here comes the trick:

- If target is let's say 14, then we adjust `nums` to this, where "inf" means infinity:  
    [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]
    
- If target is let's say 7, then we adjust `nums` to this:  
    [-inf, -inf, -inf, -inf, -inf, -inf, -inf, -inf, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
    

And then we can simply do ordinary binary search.

Of course we don't actually adjust the whole array but instead adjust only on the fly only the elements we look at. And the adjustment is done by comparing both the target and the actual element against nums[0].
