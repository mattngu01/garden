## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:

        answer = []
        set_candidates = set(candidates)

        for x in candidates:
            print("starting call: ", target, x)
            a = self.recursiveCombinationSum(target - x, candidates)

            if a is not None:
                answer.append([x] + a)
            # do some kind of recursive starting with target - x
            # if the answer is valid, append the answer to the answer

        return answer
    
    def recursiveCombinationSum(self, target, candidates):
        if target == 0:
            return []
        
        if target < 0:
            return None

        for potential in candidates:
            print("starting recursive call:", target, potential)
            a = self.recursiveCombinationSum(target-potential, candidates)
            if a is None:
                return None
            else:
                return [potential] + a
```

**Peeked at solution?:** yeah, i couldn't get the solution within about 30 minutes

## submitted solution, explained

I like to think I kind of had it, but really I just didn't know how to put the answer together. This kept ending prematurely, which was not good.

## The actual solution

ngl I kind of give up 
```Python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        return self.recursiveCombinationSum(target, candidates, [], [])
    
    def recursiveCombinationSum(self, target, candidates, answer, current_combination):
        
        sum_of_combination = sum(current_combination)

        if sum_of_combination > target:
            return

        if sum_of_combination == target:
            answer.append(current_combination)
            return

        for x in candidates:
            self.recursiveCombinationSum(target, candidates, answer, current_combination + [x])
        
        return answer
```

so close yet so far, i can't get rid of duplicates for some reason

```Python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        answer = []
        self.recursiveCombinationSum(target, candidates, answer, [])

        return answer
    
    def recursiveCombinationSum(self, target, candidates, answer, current_combination):
        
        print(candidates)
        if target < 0:
            return

        if target == 0:
            answer.append(current_combination)
            return

        for x in range(len(candidates)):
            self.recursiveCombinationSum(target - candidates[x], candidates[x:], answer, current_combination + [candidates[x]])
        
```

note to self: focus on solving the actual problem, not about optimizations yet
