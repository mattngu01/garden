## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])
        index = 0
        while index < len(intervals)-1:
            first = intervals[index]
            second = intervals[index+1]

            if self.isOverlapping(first, second):
                intervals[index] = self.mergeIntervals(first, second)
                del intervals[index+1]
            else:
                index += 1

        return intervals

    def isOverlapping(self, first, second):
        lower = min(first, second, key=lambda x: x[0])
        higher = max(first, second, key=lambda x: x[1])

        return lower[1] >= higher[0] or lower == higher

    def mergeIntervals(self, first, second):
        lower = min(first, second, key=lambda x: x[0])
        higher = max(first, second, key=lambda x: x[1])

        return [min(first + second), max(first + second)]
```

**Peeked at solution?:** finished in <15 minutes!! not optimized though, didn't peek

## submitted solution, explained  

1. sort in the beginning because the intervals aren't necessarily sorted
2. merge ones that are overlapping (use some special python stuff, not sure how to do this clean in other languages tbh)

the "optimized" solutions are essentially the same as this
