## submitted solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        left_path = self.dfsLCA([root], root, p)
        right_path = self.dfsLCA([root], root, q)

        min_path = min(left_path, right_path, key=len)
        index = 0

        while index < len(min_path):
            if left_path[index] != right_path[index]:
                return left_path[index-1]
            
            index += 1
        
        return min_path[-1]
    
    def dfsLCA(self, path, current_node, target_node):
        if target_node in path:
            return path
        
        if current_node == None:
            return None
        
        left = self.dfsLCA(path + [current_node.left], current_node.left, target_node) 
        right = self.dfsLCA(path + [current_node.right], current_node.right, target_node)

        if left is not None: return left
        if right is not None: return right

        return None

```

**Peeked at solution?:** Yeah, had to google a general solution on how to solve it then implemented it

## submitted solution, explained

Get the path to each desired node. Wherever the paths deviate, then the one before that is the least-common-ancestor (LCA). If one ends before the other and they're part of the same path, the wherever it ends is the LCA.

The optimized solutions are pretty much the same as what I did, but better to read than mine lol.

```java
public class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root == null || root == p || root == q)  return root;
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        if(left != null && right != null)   return root;
        return left != null ? left : right;
    }
}
```
