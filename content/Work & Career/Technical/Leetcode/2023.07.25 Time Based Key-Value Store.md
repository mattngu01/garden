    def __init__(self):
        self.time_map = defaultdict(dict)
        self.highest_timestamp = dict()
        self.lowest_timestamp = dict()
        

    def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
        self.time_map[key][timestamp] = value

        if key in self.highest_timestamp:
            self.highest_timestamp[key] = max(self.highest_timestamp[key], timestamp)
        else:
            self.highest_timestamp[key] = timestamp

        if key in self.lowest_timestamp:
            self.lowest_timestamp[key] = min(self.lowest_timestamp[key], timestamp)
        else:
            self.lowest_timestamp[key] = timestamp
        

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:
        if key not in self.time_map or timestamp < self.lowest_timestamp[key]:
            return ""

        if timestamp > self.highest_timestamp[key]:
            return self.time_map[key][self.highest_timestamp[key]]

        if timestamp in self.time_map[key].keys():
            return self.time_map[key][timestamp]
                
        # if the timestamp wanted is under the highest_timestamp
        # probably do binary search it, find the one inbetween - eh.... don't feel like writing binary search
        for x in self.time_map[key].keys():
            if timestamp > x:
                return self.time_map[key][x]
        

        


# Your TimeMap object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = TimeMap()
# obj.set(key,value,timestamp)
# param_2 = obj.get(key,timestamp)
```

## submitted solution, explained

honestly should've gotten this faster, I got real confused for awhile on what the problem actually meant :/

pretty much, return the timestamp if it exists. If it doesn't, find the next biggest timestamp. If the requested timestamp is lower than the first one, then return "".

Also, the supposed actual solution is supposed to point you towards binary search. This solution did a lot better compared to other answers apparently, so I'm just keeping this because I don't really want to write out binary search.
