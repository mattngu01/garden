## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """

        index = 1

        while index < len(nums):
            jump_back = index
            if index >= 0 and nums[index-1] > nums[index]:
                self.swap(nums, index, index-1)
                if index > 1: index -= 1
            else:
                index = max(jump_back, index)
                index += 1

    def swap(self, nums, i, j):
        temp = nums[i]
        nums[i] = nums[j]
        nums[j] = temp
```

## submitted solution, explained

The submitted solution is just bubble sort / swap sort w/ jumping back to the original position when the element is put into the right spot.

The optimized solution is apparently this:

> One [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) is to have the top group grow down from the top of the array, the bottom group grow up from the bottom, and keep the middle group just above the bottom. The algorithm indexes three locations, the bottom of the top group, the top of the bottom group, and the top of the middle group. Elements that are yet to be sorted fall between the middle and the top group.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem#cite_note-NIST-4) At each step, examine the element just above the middle. If it belongs to the top group, swap it with the element just below the top. If it belongs in the bottom, swap it with the element just above the bottom. If it is in the middle, leave it. Update the appropriate index. Complexity is Θ(n) moves and examinations.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem#cite_note-monash-1)

imo, i don't think this is a great problem as to do this "correctly" requires prior knowledge of this specific type of sort.
