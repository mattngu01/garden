**Peeked at solution?:** yes, didn't solve it after 30 minutes & gave up

## submitted solution, explained

I pretty much had it, but I was missing an important part where I needed to do dynamic programming. I had the brute force method down. Essentially, build up a word and check if it's in the word dict. 

If it does, then it splits into two paths. Otherwise, keep going ahead.

The solution with dynamic programming:
1. have an equivalent to the string, but T/F. This will keep track of whether there is a word at a particular index.
2. Similar to a sliding window, compare every substring from 0 to current_index and check if the start of the substring is right after a "valid" word (double check in the boolean array)


also apparently trie also solves this
