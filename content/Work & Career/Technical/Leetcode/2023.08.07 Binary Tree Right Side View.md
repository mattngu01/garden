## submitted solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        answer = [] #representing the "right most" node at every depth / height

        queue = deque()
        depthQueue = deque()

        if root is not None:
            queue.append(root)
            depthQueue.append(0)

        while len(queue) > 0:
            current = queue.popleft()
            depth = depthQueue.popleft()

            if len(answer)-1 < depth:
                answer.append(current.val)
            else:
                answer[depth] = current.val
            
            if current.left is not None:
                queue.append(current.left)
                depthQueue.append(depth + 1)
            
            if current.right is not None:
                queue.append(current.right)
                depthQueue.append(depth + 1)
                    
        return answer
```

**Peeked at solution?:** a little, looked up how to keep track of depth within BFS. However, ended up not really using it

## submitted solution, explained

Do BFS. Since BFS goes down level by level, the last one to be processed will be the "right most side" node. This is a little confusing as the description / examples indicate that all you need to do is look at the right side only, which you want the right*most* side.
