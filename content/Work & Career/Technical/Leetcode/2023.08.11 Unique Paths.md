## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        memo = []
        for y in range(m):
            memo.append([-1 for x in range(n)])
        return self.recursiveUniquePaths(0, 0, m, n, memo)

    def recursiveUniquePaths(self, x, y, m, n, memo):
        if y >= m or x >= n:
            return 0

        if (x, y) == (n-1, m-1) or x == n-1 or y == m-1:
            return 1
        
        if memo[y][x] != -1:
            answer = memo[y][x]
        else:
            answer = self.recursiveUniquePaths(x+1, y, m, n, memo) + self.recursiveUniquePaths(x, y+1, m, n, memo)
            memo[y][x] = answer
        return answer
```

**Peeked at solution?:** Yes, I honestly got impatient. I think I could've figured it out eventually, but my mind was not being flexible atm

## submitted solution, explained

Classic DP problem. Should've gotten this first try :/
