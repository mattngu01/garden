## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        first = 0
        second = len(height)-1
        max_height = 0

        while first < second:
            max_height = max(max_height, min(height[first], height[second]) * (second-first))
            
            print(first, second, max_height)
            if second > 0 and min(height[first], height[second-1]) * (second-1-first) > max_height:
                second -= 1
                break
            else:
                first += 1

        return max_height
```

## submitted solution, explained
feeling really dumb, if the `height[first]` < `height[second]` then `first += 1` and vice versa. 

I essentially had it, but just needed the condition on which to increase / decrease the sliding pointers. This is the kind of problem that you need to just know?
