        all_combos = []
        self.recursiveCombos(digits, "", all_combos)
        return all_combos

    def recursiveCombos(self, digits, current, all_combos):
        if len(digits) == 0:
            return current
        
        for letter in self.letters[digits[0]]:
            result = self.recursiveCombos(digits[1:], current + letter, all_combos)

            if result is not None:
                all_combos.append(result)

## submitted solution, explained

Pretty much simple backtracking. I thought we had to use memoization or something here, but I guess not.

The `result is not None` is to account for runs that go past the for loop, and in Python ends up returning `None`.

I oddly took a long time and had trouble coming up with this solution, so we should revisit this.
