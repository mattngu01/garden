## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        visited = []

        for row in range(len(board)):
            visited.append([False for col in range(len(board[0]))])
        
        exists = False
        for row in range(len(board)):
            for col in range(len(board[0])):
                exists = exists or self.dfs(row, col, board, word)
        
        return exists


    def dfs(self, r, c, board, word):
        if len(word) == 0:
            return True

        if r < 0 or r >= len(board) or c < 0 or c >= len(board[0]) or board[r][c] != word[0]:
            return False
        
        tmp = board[r][c]
        board[r][c] = "#"

        possible = self.dfs(r-1, c, board, word[1:]) or self.dfs(r+1, c, board, word[1:]) or self.dfs(r, c-1, board, word[1:]) or self.dfs(r, c+1, board, word[1:])

        board[r][c] = tmp
        return possible
```

**Peeked at solution?:** Yeah, but honestly gave up bc it took too much time

## submitted solution, explained

DFS. No need to build a list of "valid" squares when you can just exit early if the row or col is out of bounds. 

Remember that we can modify the board after our recursion call, this is important for backtracking and probably dfs as well.
