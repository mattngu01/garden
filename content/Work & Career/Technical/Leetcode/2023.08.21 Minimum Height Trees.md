## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        nodes = defaultdict(set)
        for x in edges:
            nodes[x[0]].add(x[1])
            nodes[x[1]].add(x[0])
        
        visited = [False for x in range(n)]

        answer = set()

        min_height = 9999
        for y in range(n):
            height = self.dfs(y, deepcopy(visited), nodes)

            if height < min_height:
                answer = set()
                min_height = height
            
            if height == min_height:
                answer.add(y)
        
        return answer
    
    def dfs(self, i, visited, nodes):
        if visited[i]:
            return 0

        visited[i] = True
        min_height = 1 + max([self.dfs(x, visited, nodes) for x in nodes[i]], default=0)
        

        return min_height    
```

**Peeked at solution?:** yeah, this solution is a copy of it

## submitted solution, explained

1. create map of correlation (two way) i.e. `[0, 1]` == `{0: [1], 1: [0]`
2. dfs -> keep track of visited, return height after running dfs on the value of current node
	1. important part in dfs is to call `max` on all of the correlating nodes
3. iterate through all numbers `0 - N` (will always be in order), keep track of minimum height and add answer based on what is minimum height

I would revisit for the DFS version of this, but honestly having to know the proof kind of sucks :/ 


### The actual solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        if not edges:
            return [0]
            
        nodes = defaultdict(set)
        for x in edges:
            nodes[x[0]].add(x[1])
            nodes[x[1]].add(x[0])
        
        leaves, new_leaves, in_degree = [], [], []

        for x in range(n):
            in_degree.append(len(nodes[x]))

            if in_degree[x] == 1: leaves.append(x)
    
        while n > 2:
            for leaf in leaves:
                for connected in nodes[leaf]:
                    in_degree[connected] -= 1
                    
                    if in_degree[connected] == 1:
                        new_leaves.append(connected)
                    
            n -= len(leaves)            
            leaves = new_leaves[:]
            new_leaves = []

        return leaves
```

What to know ahead of time:
- the max amount of minimum height trees is 2, look online for proof
