## submitted solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        
        all_nodes = []

        queue = deque()

        if root is not None:
            queue.append(root)
        
        while len(queue) > 0:
            current = queue.popleft()
            all_nodes.append(current.val)

            if current.left:
                queue.append(current.left)
            
            if current.right:
                queue.append(current.right)
        
        return sorted(all_nodes)[k-1]
```

**Peeked at solution?:** No

## submitted solution, explained

BST, sort then return whatever.


The actual optimized solution is a DFS recursive that stops early when you meet `kth`. I thought of this originally, but couldn't really think of a way to get this to work.
