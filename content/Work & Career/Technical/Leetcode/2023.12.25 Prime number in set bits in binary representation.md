## submitted solution, explained

You can figure the binary representation of a number by dividing by 2 until the number is 0. The remainder determines if the number is a "1" in the binary representation or not. You can build it by reading in reverse order.

Optimal solution: there's a function called `.bit_count()` that natively gets the number of bits in a number.
