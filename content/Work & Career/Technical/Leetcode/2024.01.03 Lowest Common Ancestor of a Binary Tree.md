## submitted solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        p_path = self.dfs(root, p.val)
        q_path = self.dfs(root, q.val)

        shorter = min(p_path, q_path, key=lambda x: len(x))
        longer = q_path if shorter[-1] == p_path[-1] else p_path

        ancestor = (root, 0) #value, depth

        for x in range(len(shorter)):
            if shorter[x] in longer:
                ancestor = max((shorter[x],  x), ancestor, key=lambda z: z[1])

        return ancestor[0]
    
    def dfs(self, root, target):
        if root.val == target:
            return [root]
        
        if root.left is not None and target < root.val:
            return [root] + self.dfs(root.left, target)

**Peeked at solution?:** No

## submitted solution, explained
- get path to `p` node & `q` node using DFS (the index of the path is the depth / height)
	- using DFS we can use teh quality of hte binary tree that left node is less than root and right is greater than the root (this way we are not aimlessly wandering through the tree)
- go through the shorter path & find matching node in other path that is "highest" depth numerically

## O(H) cpu / O(1) memory
- we can take advantage of the fact of the binary tree that left nodes are less than the root and right nodes are greater than the root
```Python
def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
    while root:
        if p.val < root.val > q.val:
            root = root.left
        elif p.val > root.val < q.val:
            root = root.right
        else:
            return root
```

This code will walk through the tree, and go towards the direction that have both p & q in the same subtree (this means that both values are either greater or less than the root). 
- if the current node is both LESS THAN p & q, then we go down the left tree
- if the current node is both GREATER THAN p & q, then we go down the right tree
- once we find a node that is between p & q, then we have found the lowest common ancestor
