## submitted solution
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
import random

class Solution:

    def __init__(self, head: Optional[ListNode]):
        self.head = head

        count = 0
        current = head
        while current != None:
            current = current.next
            count += 1

        self.length = count

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        index = random.randint(0, self.length - 1)
        count = index
        current = self.head

        while count > 0:
            current = current.next
            count -= 1
        
        return current.val
        


# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(head)
# param_1 = obj.getRandom()
```

**Peeked at solution?:** Yes

## submitted solution, explained

- I had done this previously. I thought that saving this in memory would be great, but not really and IMO defeats the purpose of this.
Supposed to flip a coin on every node, and that would decide if you are continuing further or not.
