## submitted solution, explained

Optimal solution:

```Java
public List<List<Integer>> combinationSum2(int[] candidates, int target) {
   List<List<Integer>> list = new LinkedList<List<Integer>>();
   Arrays.sort(candidates);
   backtrack(list, new ArrayList<Integer>(), candidates, target, 0);
   return list;
}

private void backtrack(List<List<Integer>> list, List<Integer> tempList, int[] cand, int remain, int start) {
   
   if(remain < 0) return; /** no solution */
   else if(remain == 0) list.add(new ArrayList<>(tempList));
   else{
      for (int i = start; i < cand.length; i++) {
         if(i > start && cand[i] == cand[i-1]) continue; /** skip duplicates */
         tempList.add(cand[i]);
         backtrack(list, tempList, cand, remain - cand[i], i+1);
         tempList.remove(tempList.size() - 1);
      }
   }
}
```

backtracking:
- what are the criteria to go back?
- what criteria are successful?
- when do we stop looking?

pattern of backtracking:
- recursive
- at the top you have the criteria for success, or no solution 
	- success: the remainder is 0, we are at the target
	- fail: remainder is negative, meaning we went past the target
- you add the current candidate to the current combination
- recursive call: you subtract the target, and your index goes up (one pass...?)
- then you take out the current candidate you just added
- todo: visualize this and go step by step debug
