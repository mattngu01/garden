## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def minNumber(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        nums1.sort()
        nums2.sort()

        common = set(nums1).intersection(nums2)
        common = sorted(list(common))

        if len(common) > 0:
            return common[0]
        else:
            lesser = min(nums1[0], nums2[0])
            greater = max(nums1[0], nums2[0])

            return (lesser * 10) + greater
```

**Peeked at solution?:** No

## submitted solution, explained
- I think it is self explanatory
- there is the possibility of having a common number between the two, if so pick the smallest
- otherwise we can pick the smallest from each list, then create a smaller number


## optimal solution
- no need to sort the lists, can use `min()` to get the smallest of each list instead
