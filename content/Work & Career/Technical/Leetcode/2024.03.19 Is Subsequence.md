        if len(s) > len(t):
            return False

        index = 0
        for x in s:
            while True:
                if index > len(t)-1:
                    return False
                
                if x == t[index]:
                    index += 1

## submitted solution, explained
- we can iterate through the smaller string, then for each character match it to the other string
	- keep track of index in bigger string, start at the index each time to keep track of characters
	- if we're stuck on a character and we reach the end of the bigger string, then it doesn't exist
