## submitted solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSumDivThree(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        answer = []
        self.bt(0, nums, answer)
        return max(answer) if answer else 0
    
    def bt(self, current_num, nums, answers):
        if current_num % 3 == 0 and current_num != 0:
            answers.append(current_num)
            return
        
        for x in range(len(nums)):
            copy_of_nums = copy.deepcopy(nums)
            num = copy_of_nums.pop(x)
            self.bt(current_num+num, copy_of_nums, answers)
```

**Peeked at solution?:** Yeah, I originally thought it was a backtracking problem but it ended up DP, then I got frustrated and stopped (:
