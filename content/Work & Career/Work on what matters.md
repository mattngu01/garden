[Work on what matters](https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters)

# Common ways to get caught up in small stuff
## Snacking
- easy and low-impact tasks -> snacks
- unlikely to learn from them (depending on your experience & role)
- need to continually track what kind of work you're doing, and its impact
- preening -> low impact, high visibility work

## Chasing ghosts
> the ghosts of their previous situation hold such a firm grasp on their understanding of the new company that they misjudge the familiar as the essential

- avoid investing in meaningless work on a grand scale


# What should you work on?
- (in the context of staff engineer) working whatever is important to the company or is vital to its survival
- work where there's room and attention
	- work on things that matter to the company but aren't swarmed by people trying to fix it
	- need to find work that the company values, or else it'll be hard to find support for it / maintain it
